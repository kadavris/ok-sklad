Long description:
This is small to medium business ERP software written in delphi 7.
Provides extensive and robust goods and financial flows accounting.
It's pseudo 3-tier system with RDBMS FirebirdSQL, rudimentary app server and very thick client.
This allows more than one simultaneous user working with different access rights,
but for the cost of unpleasant delays with 5 seats and more and possible frequent lockup warnings in process.
It also have speed issues with databases containing 10K+ of goods descriptions and about the same quantity of documents of any kind.


Due to it's complexity it depends on many free and commercial 3rd party libraries.
The full list is in Dependencies.txt
Any images containing logo and other kinds of trademarks was replaced by generic placeholders.
The code is provided AS IS with no warranties or sincere promises applied.
You may and should groan when you'll encounter almost uncommented code.
Alas, we received it in this state and I've done what I could, but you know...


A bit of history:
I (Andrej Pakhutin) worked on this project single-handedly after it was bought by Irystyle in 2005.
Since 2008 after numerous hours of me and one of the owners discussing project restart
involving shift to real application server written in C++ and with thin and mobile clients.
So this project was slowly abandoned till 2010 and due to financial issues
became a point of only mine historical interest since then.


I don't think that it will going up again, but it can still contain some useful tricks
or outrageous fuckups to learn on to.


Good luck!
