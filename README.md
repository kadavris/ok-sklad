Long description:
This is small to medium business ERP software written in delphi 7.
Provides extensive and robust goods and financial flows accounting.
It is pseudo 3-tier system incorporating RDBMS FirebirdSQL and has rudimentary app server and a very thick client.
This allows more than one simultaneous user working with different access rights,
but for the cost of unpleasant delays with 5+ seats and possible frequent lockup warnings in process.
The client also have some speed issues with databases containing more than 10K of goods descriptions
and/or about the same quantity of documents of any kind.

Due to it's complexity it depends on many free and commercial 3rd party libraries.
You can find the full list in Dependencies.txt
Any images containing logo and other kinds of trademarks was replaced by generic placeholders.
The code is provided AS IS with no warranties or sincere promises applied.
You may and should groan when you'll encounter almost uncommented code.
Alas, we (Irystyle) received it in this messy state and I've done what I could, but you know...

A bit of history:
I (Andrej Pakhutin) worked on this project single-handedly after it was bought by Irystyle in 2005.
Since 2008 there were numerous hours of myself and one of the owners discussing project restart,
involving the shift to real application server, written in C++ governing thin and mobile clients.
But due to financial and personal issues, this project was slowly abandoned to the stop in 2010.
It became a point of mine only, historical interest since then.

This code still contain some useful tricks or outrageous fuckups to learn on to.

Good luck!
